## The Robot Game 

Using a LEGO MINDSTORMS or Inventor robot kit, a team designs, builds and programs an autonomous robot to achieve specific missions and earn points. Robots compete in three 2.5 minute rounds in an attempt to earn as many points as possible, and teams are evaluated on mechanical design, programming, and innovation & strategy.

## The Innovation Project
 
Teams conduct research to solve a real-world problem, develop an innovative solution, share their findings with community stakeholders, and present their work at the competition. They are evaluated in research, innovative solution and presentation.
    
## Robot Design and Programming

Teams build and program robot using EV3 or Spike PRIME or MINDSTORMS Inventor and share their work at the competition. Teams are evaluated on their engineering process of both robot design and robot programming, explaining their design iterations and strategies.

## Core Values    

The FIRST Core Values are the cornerstones of the program. Teams are evaluated on HOW they work together, as well as inspiration, teamwork and gracious professionalism.

This team-based, hands-on, competitive robotics program provides challenging and exciting learning opportunities for young people. It spurs innovation, develops teamwork and leadership skills and promotes excitement in science and technology.
