## FIRST TECH CHALLENGE

FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) teams use a variety of tools and software to design, program, and manage their robotics projects. Here's a rundown of some of the key tools and software commonly used by FTC teams:

### Programming and Robotics

1. **FTC Robot Controller and Driver Station Apps**
   - These are essential apps for controlling the robot during competitions. The Robot Controller app runs on the robot's Android device, while the Driver Station app is used by the team to control the robot.
