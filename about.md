# About

**Eureka Robotix teams are student-led, community First Robotics Leage Team**.Team Eureka participates in the [FIRST League Challenges](https://firstintexas.org/) such as [FLL](https://www.firstlegoleague.org/)and [FTC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc) in Texas and World events. It is part of a global robotics program that includes more than 480,000 kids in 110 countries. Team Eurekaâ€™s involvement in FIRST events, has been bringing FIRST LEGO League Challenge to kids interested in participating since 2019.

#### Our Journey <a href="#our-journey" id="our-journey"></a>

Team Eureka arose from the personal interest of Pranav Maheshwaran, who is avid LEGO builder since age of 4. His keen interest in building complex LEGO models inspired Coaches/Mentors Mahesh and Geetha to start this Team Eureka as [FLL Explore team](https://msubra.github.io/2020), which has evolved as FLL Challenge team, now a FTC team. Over the years, we have competed in various local and international competitions, showcasing our skills in building and programming autonomous robots.

We were able to attract similar interest people from various industry and organization to be part of the team or mentor the team

#### The Challenge <a href="#the-challenge" id="the-challenge"></a>

Teams collaborate to build and program an autonomous robot to score points on a thematic playing surface (the Robot Game) and create an innovative solution to a problem correlating to the yearly theme (the Innovation Project), all guided by the FIRST Core Values. These elements make up what is called The Challenge. The theme of The Challenge changes every year and is based on a real-world scientific topic. Past challenges have included topics such as space, nanotechnology, biomedical, climate change, recycling, and transportation.

#### Our Mission <a href="#our-mission" id="our-mission"></a>

What started as a Explore team, is now clocking six-years in journey, participating in numerous events, learnings new topics, solving technical challenges. We want to give back to the community who helped in fostering our team. Eureka Robotix is dedicated to fostering a love for STEM among young students. This website is an effort to that commitment.

**Educate**: Share our knowledge and experiences in building and programming with the wider community.

**Innovate**: Continuously develop creative solutions to real-world problems.

**Inspire**: Encourage other kids to explore STEM fields through hands-on learning and participation in FIRST events.
